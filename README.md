**DESCRIPTION:** This assignment is from *The Odin Project: Full Stack Ruby on Rails* Web Development [curriculum](https://theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/ruby-final-project).

**OBJECTIVE:** The purpose of this project was to create a 2-player command line chess game using Ruby.   The game is played until a player is either in checkmate or stalemate.  It includes implementations for all special moves – en passant, castling, and pawn promotions.  It prevents players from making illegal moves such as moving their opponent’s pieces, moving a king into check, and moving pieces in incorrect directions.   At any time during game play, the user may opt to exit and save their current game.  On game start, the user may then choose a brand-new game or load an existing save game file.

**SKILLS DEMONSTRATED:**
* Object Oriented programming using multiple classes and inheritance
*	Modules and mixins
*	File Serialization using YAML (to save and load game files)
*	Input and Output
*	Methods
*	Conditional Logic
*	Loops
*	Arrays
*	Hashes
*	String manipulation
*	Unicode characters
